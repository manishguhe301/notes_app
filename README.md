# React + Vite

This project uses React and Vite to provide a minimal setup with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Node.js and npm/yarn on your local machine.

## Official Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- @vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
- @vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh

## Running the App Locally

To install the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd <project-name>`.
3. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

To run the app, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev

or

yarn dev

The app will start running on  http://127.0.0.1:5173/.

Please replace `<repository-url>` and `<project-name>` with the actual repository URL and project name respectively.
